# Music Recommendation System

This project implements a simple music recommendation system using machine learning techniques. It processes a large dataset of music tracks provided by Spotify.

## Features

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Transforms raw music track data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Applies One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables and TF-IDF for genre information.
3. **Recommendation System**: Implements a nearest neighbors approach for song recommendations.
4. **Streamlit app**: A demo is available on Streamlit.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms (PCA, K-means, preprocessing)
- Plotly: For interactive data visualization
